# Movie Review Analysis 👍 👎 ⚖️

## Project Objective 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to conduct sentiment analysis on text data. Given a sentence, the project's objective is to classify whether the sentence expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis is a crucial natural language processing (NLP) task that helps in understanding the emotional tone of text, making it valuable in various applications, such as customer reviews, social media analysis, and more.

## Project Overview 📚
🎓 **Capstone Project - Data Analytics Program with Azubi Africa**

This project serves as the culmination of a 9-month Data Analytics program with Azubi Africa. Its focus is on the analysis of movie reviews and their classification into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. By leveraging Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project provides accurate sentiment predictions for movie reviews.

## Notable Features 🌟
The project encompasses several notable features, including:

- **Data Collection**: The gathering of a balanced dataset of movie reviews with sentiment labels.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: A comprehensive exploration of the dataset to gain insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The utilization of NLP tools to clean and prepare text data for model training.
- **Model Training**: The training of various machine learning models for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: An assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of models through grid search and cross-validation.
- **App Deployment**: The deployment of a user-friendly sentiment analysis app on Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Setup 🛠️
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone '<https://github.com/EnyonamAgbenorhevi/Movie_Review_Sentiment_Capstone>'
   ```

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Movie_Review_Sentiment_Capstone
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   It's recommended to isolate project dependencies, which helps prevent conflicts with system-wide Python packages.:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and experimentation.
7. Run the Streamlit app for real-time sentiment analysis:

   ```bash
   Streamlit run app.py
   ```
